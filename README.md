# Cloud-Native Data Intake Patterns: Best Practices for Azure

## Audience
- Engineering team experienced in .NET, MSSQL, and on-prem deployments
- New to Azure and cloud-native paradigms

---

## üìå Objectives
- Introduce common cloud-native data intake patterns
- Explain how each pattern maps to Azure services
- Share best practices for scalability, reliability, and cost optimization
- Set foundational standards for moving from on-prem to cloud ETL

---

## üß± Core Concepts

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Cloud-native ETL orchestration
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute for lightweight processing
- **Azure API Management (APIM)**: Secure and manage internal/external APIs
- **Event Grid / Blob Storage Events**: Event-driven ingestion
- **Azure SQL & CDC**: Change tracking and data movement
- **Logic Apps / ADF Pipelines**: Time-based orchestration

---

## 1. üì° API-Based Data Intake

### Scenario
Third-party or internal APIs provide structured data (e.g. JSON/XML) on request or event.

### Components
- Azure API Management
- Azure Functions (intermediary)
- Azure Data Factory (or Synapse pipelines)

### Flow
``Client ‚Üí APIM ‚Üí Azure Function ‚Üí ADF Trigger``

### Best Practices
- Use APIM to manage throttling, authentication, and versioning
- Functions should be lightweight and stateless
- Secure API endpoints using Azure AD or managed identities
- Log structured telemetry with Application Insights

---

## 2. üìÅ Internal File-Based Ingestion

### Scenario
Business users or systems drop files (CSV, JSON, Excel) into a folder or shared location.

### Components
- Azure Blob Storage (or ADLS Gen2)
- Azure Event Grid (for file trigger)
- Azure Data Factory (for pipeline trigger and ingestion)

### Flow
``File Upload ‚Üí Event Grid ‚Üí ADF Pipeline Trigger ‚Üí Ingest to SQL/Blob``

### Best Practices
- Enforce naming conventions and folder structures
- Use managed identity to secure storage access
- Validate file schema and data quality in staging zone
- Archive files post-processing for traceability

---

## 3. üîÑ Database Change Data Capture (CDC)

### Scenario
Track and move only the changed records from an on-prem or cloud SQL database.

### Components
- Azure SQL Database (or SQL MI with CDC enabled)
- Self-hosted Integration Runtime (if on-prem)
- ADF Mapping Data Flows or Pipelines

### Flow
``SQL CDC Log ‚Üí ADF Polling/Mapping Flow ‚Üí Data Lake / DW``

### Best Practices
- Enable CDC or Change Tracking on source tables
- Schedule regular incremental loads instead of full loads
- Tune retention and log cleanup settings
- Monitor latency and missed changes

---

## 4. üïí Cron-Based Task Scheduling

### Scenario
Periodic (e.g., nightly or hourly) tasks that trigger batch loads or API calls.

### Components
- Azure Data Factory (Scheduled Triggers)
- Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions (for light orchestration)

### Flow
``Timer Trigger ‚Üí ADF Pipeline Execution ‚Üí ETL Logic``

### Best Practices
- Define scheduling in UTC for consistency
- Use parameterized pipelines for reusability
- Use alerting on pipeline failure (via Monitor/Azure Alerts)
- Avoid overlapping runs with pipeline concurrency control

---

## üö¶ Governance & Security Considerations

- Implement **RBAC** and **Managed Identities**
- Use **Private Endpoints** for Data Factory and Storage
- Monitor all pipelines and storage events with **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics**
- Implement **cost alerts and budgets** to track usage during early adoption

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Enablement

- Use **Azure DevOps or GitHub** for CI/CD of ADF pipelines
- Leverage **ARM Templates or Bicep** to deploy infrastructure
- Use **parameter files** to support multiple environments (dev/test/prod)
